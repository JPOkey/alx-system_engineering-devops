On May 7, 2023, from 2:30 PM to 4:45 PM EST, users of our social media platform experienced difficulties accessing the site, and those who could access it experienced slow loading times. This outage affected 80% of our users and had a significant impact on our daily active user count.

Timeline:

2:30 PM - The issue was detected when our monitoring system alerted us to increased server response times.
2:35 PM - Our engineering team began investigating the issue, assuming that it was a database problem.
2:50 PM - After investigating the database, it was determined that the issue was not related to the database.
3:05 PM - Investigation then shifted to the network and server infrastructure.
3:30 PM - After analyzing the network and server infrastructure, no issues were found, but it was noticed that the load balancer was having difficulty distributing traffic.
3:45 PM - Our team contacted the vendor who supplied the load balancer to troubleshoot the issue.
4:15 PM - After consultation with the vendor, the issue was resolved by updating the load balancer firmware.
4:45 PM - Our social media platform was fully restored, and all users could access it without issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was found to be an outdated firmware version on our load balancer. The outdated firmware was causing the load balancer to have difficulty distributing traffic, leading to slow response times and eventual server failure.

To fix the issue, we updated the firmware version of the load balancer to the latest version. After the update, the load balancer was able to properly distribute traffic, and the social media platform was restored to full functionality.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar outages in the future, we have implemented the following measures:

Scheduled firmware updates for all critical infrastructure components
Increased monitoring and alerts for load balancer performance
Improved communication and escalation procedures for vendor support
Regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues
Tasks to address the issue include:

Schedule regular firmware updates for all critical infrastructure components
Implement additional monitoring and alerts for load balancer performance
Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues
Review and update communication and escalation procedures for vendor support
In conclusion, we apologize for any inconvenience this outage may have caused our users. We take these incidents seriously and will continue to work to improve our infrastructure to ensure the highest level of service reliability for our users.
